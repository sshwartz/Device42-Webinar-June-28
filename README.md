# Device42-Webinar-June-28

This repository contains two files:

outlier_detection_for_webinar.py - This is the file of Python code that runs 3 different anomaly detection algorithms:  COPOD, LOF, and Isolation Forests.  The code is setup to run the COPOD algorithm.  To run the other two, uncomment the lines at the bottom of the file.

device_service.txt - This is a file containing the data, i.e. which process names are present on which devices.
